# ADXL335 Accelerometer
- The ADXL335 is a sensor which detects change in motion, vibration or tilting along three axes X, Y and Z. 
- It measures acceleration values in terms of g.
-  The output of the sensor is analog output that measures acceleration in 3 axes X, Y and Z namely X-out, Y-out and Z-out respectively.
-  The ***output range*** of the accelerometer is 0 to 3.3 V (when powered by 3.3 V supply) and the mid point of the supply voltage 1.65 V means 0g acceleration.
-  Typical or maximum sensitivity of the accelerometer is 330 mv/g. For every 1g cahnge in acceleration, the output voltage changes by approximately 0.33 V.

 ***Range of the ADXL335***
  - Accelerometer can measure acceleration in the range of ±3g for each axis.
  - At +3g the output voltage is approximately equal to 2.64 V and at -3g the output voltage is approximately equal to 0.66 V.
  
  ***Power Supply***
  - Operates on a 1.8 V to 3.6 V supply.
  - Typical supply current is 350 μA.
    
  ***Temperature Range***
  - Operates from -40°C to +85°C.
    
  ***Noise***
  - Noise density is 150 μg/√Hz rms (typical).
